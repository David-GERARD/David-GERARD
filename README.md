# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## 📌 About Me
I'm **David Gérard**, a Ph.D. student at **UCL** in the [**Connected Electronics and Photonics Center for Doctoral Training**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/study/postgraduate-research/cdt-photonic-and-electronic-systems). My expertise bridges **machine learning software and hardware**, with a strong focus on **neuromorphic computing** and **AI acceleration** for **energy-efficient AI**.  

I have experience in both **academic research and industry projects**, with a background in **biomedical engineering, AI, and hardware-software co-design**.

  <summary><h2>💡 My Values</h2></summary>
  
  ### **Collaborative Research & Knowledge Sharing**
  Science thrives in collaboration. I actively support **cross-disciplinary, international, and open collaborations** to accelerate innovation. I contribute to and **maintain open-source projects** that facilitate knowledge exchange and help researchers share their work efficiently.
  
  ### **Reproducibility & Best Practices**
  Reproducibility is a cornerstone of reliable research. I promote **best practices in software development** for academic projects, including:
  - Version control with **Git & GitHub**.
  - Clear **documentation & code modularity**.
  - Use of **containerized environments** to enable seamless replication of experiments.
  
  ### **Pushing for Open-Source Adoption in Academia**
  Too often, research is tied to proprietary tools that restrict innovation. I push for increased adoption of **open-source frameworks, tools, and methodologies** to:
  - Reduce barriers for researchers worldwide.
  - Increase transparency in peer-reviewed research.
  
  By integrating **open-source tools in research workflows**, we can make academic research more **accessible, collaborative, and efficient**.
